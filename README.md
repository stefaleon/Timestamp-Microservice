#Timestamp Microservice

* Pass a string as a request parameter, and it will be checked to see whether it contains either a Unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
* If it does, both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date are returned.
* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, null is returned for those properties.
